Hello world tests for UberAny

These folders demonstrate how you can setup and run applications in various languages using the UberAny Docker.

Technically each of these folders should really be in it's own repo for use with UberAny - you call the specific repo to load and run at startup. I've just consolodated them into a single repo to make it easier for me to manage.
